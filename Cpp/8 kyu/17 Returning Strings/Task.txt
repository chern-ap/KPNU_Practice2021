Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

Sample Tests:

Describe(Greet)
{
    It(BasicTests)
    {
        Assert::That(greet("Ryan"), Equals("Hello, Ryan how are you doing today?"));
        Assert::That(greet("Shingles"), Equals("Hello, Shingles how are you doing today?"));
    }
};
