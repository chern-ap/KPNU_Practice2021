Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

Sample Tests:

Describe(test_square_sum)
{
    It(should_pass_some_basic_tests)
    {
        Assert::That(square_sum({1, 2}), Equals(5));
        Assert::That(square_sum({0, 3, 4, 5}), Equals(50));
        Assert::That(square_sum({}), Equals(0));
    }
};
