Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

Sample Tests:
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class OppositesAttractTest {

  @Test
  public void testOddAndEven() {
    assertEquals(true, OppositesAttract.isLove(1, 4));
  }
  
  @Test
  public void testEvenAndEven() {
    assertEquals(false, OppositesAttract.isLove(2, 2));
  }
  
  @Test
  public void testOddAndOdd() {
    assertEquals(false, OppositesAttract.isLove(1, 1));
  }
  
  @Test
  public void testEvenAndOdd() {
    assertEquals(true, OppositesAttract.isLove(0, 1));
  }
  
}
