It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
Sample Tests:
Describe(Slicing_String)
{
    It(Check_Short_Length_String)
    {
        Assert::That(sliceString("tuna"), Equals("un"));
           Assert::That(sliceString("rats"), Equals("at"));
              Assert::That(sliceString("code"), Equals("od"));
    }
    It(Check_Longer_String)
    {
        Assert::That(sliceString("country"), Equals("ountr"));
           Assert::That(sliceString("place"), Equals("lac"));
              Assert::That(sliceString("translation"), Equals("ranslatio"));
    }
};
