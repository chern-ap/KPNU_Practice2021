You are given the length and width of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.
If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.

area_or_perimeter(6, 10) --> 32
area_or_perimeter(3, 3) --> 9

    Note: for the purposes of this kata you will assume that it is a square if its length and width are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.

// TODO: Replace examples and use TDD development by writing your own tests. The code provided here is just a how-to example.

#include <criterion/criterion.h>

int area_or_perimeter(int,int);

Test(Basic_tests, Simple_tests) {
    cr_assert_eq(area_or_perimeter(3 , 3) , 9);
    cr_assert_eq(area_or_perimeter(6 , 10) , 32);
}
