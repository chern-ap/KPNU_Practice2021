This code should store "codewa.rs" as a variable called name but it's not working. Can you figure out why?

#include <string>

std::string a == "code";
std::string b == "wa.rs";
std::string name == a + b;

Sample Tests:
Describe(test)
{
    It(correct_value)
    {
        Assert::That(name, Equals("codewa.rs"));
    }
};
