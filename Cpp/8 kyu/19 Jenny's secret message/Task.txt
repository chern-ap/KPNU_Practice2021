Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user. However, she's in love with Johnny, and would like to greet him slightly different. She added a special case to her function, but she made a mistake.

Can you help her?

Sample Tests:

Describe(greet_normally)
{
  It(should_append_names)
  {
    Assert::That(greet("James"), Equals("Hello, James!"));
    Assert::That(greet("Jane"), Equals("Hello, Jane!"));
    Assert::That(greet("Jim"), Equals("Hello, Jim!"));
  }
};

Describe(greet_johnny)
{
  It(should_be_a_little_more_special)
  {
    Assert::That(greet("Johnny"), Equals("Hello, my love!"));
  }
};
