Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

    S is misinterpreted as 5
    O is misinterpreted as 0
    I is misinterpreted as 1

The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

Sample Tests:

#include <criterion/criterion.h>

char *correct(char*);

Test(ExampleTests, ShouldPassAllTheTestsProvided) {
  {
    char source[] = "L0ND0N";
    cr_assert_str_eq(correct(source),"LONDON");
  }
  
  {
    char source[] = "DUBL1N";
    cr_assert_str_eq(correct(source),"DUBLIN");
  }
  
  {
    char source[] = "51NGAP0RE";
    cr_assert_str_eq(correct(source),"SINGAPORE");
  }
  
  {
    char source[] = "BUDAPE5T";
    cr_assert_str_eq(correct(source),"BUDAPEST");
  }
    
  {
    char source[] = "PAR15";
    cr_assert_str_eq(correct(source),"PARIS");
  }
}
